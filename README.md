Yolanda: I added quite a bit to your "making figures chapter", and also the "finding your way" chapter. Let me know what you think. I feel like we are nearly finished (?) I think we could probably move onto developing one lab for the BIOL 2000- core courses (!)... drawn from the carpentaries... a few exercises on clearing data with some topic-relevant data... (R packages and github are usually good for this)... could it be !?!
