TO DO for Quant TA

1. boxplots are discussed in the botany lab, however, this would be better to be moved into this manual and linked to from Botany where needed.
2. boxplots require the data to be formatted as a data frame with a specific format. It would be good to do discuss under plot() that plot(x2) is okay (rather than plot(x,y)) provided x2 is a data frame with two columns.
3. In BIOL 1002, grouping is covered via linking out to an external website. It would be good to reproduce this content in this guide so we aren't relying on another website.
4. All the data sets needed are on the respective githubs. We would try to make a system where they can be easily downloaded for instructors/students
