# Advanced graphing - silhouettes {#silhouettes}

## Introduction

Read about the [rphylopic](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rphylopic/readme/README.html) package.

Read about the function [add_phylopic()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rphylopic/versions/0.3.0/topics/add_phylopic)

## Adding silhouettes in ggplot

The following code from [here](https://scrogster.wordpress.com/2014/06/02/adding-phylopic-org-silhouettes-to-r-plots/), will work if the rphylopic package isnâ€™t working well:
```{r}
# You need to install these packages first
library(png)
library(RCurl)
library(ggplot2)
library(rphylopic)

# go to phylopic.org and search for your image. Click on the image you want (twice) # and the url should be similar to as below:

squidurl<-"http://phylopic.org/assets/images/submissions/938a7ea7-5262-4bbb-85ba-cb39181002f0.512.png"
kiwiurl<-"http://phylopic.org/assets/images/submissions/ad7d0f80-889e-4dba-a89d-c864f2f48184.512.png"
# Read in the PNG file:
squid <-  readPNG(getURLContent(squidurl))
kiwi <-  readPNG(getURLContent(kiwiurl))

# Some fake data to make a graph with
data = data.frame(x = seq(1,10), y = sample(1:10))

g=ggplot(data, aes(x=x,y=y))+
  geom_point()

# Note that add_phylopic is added as a layer to the ggplot()
g + add_phylopic(squid,alpha=.5,x=5,y=7,ysize=7) + add_phylopic(kiwi,1,3,4,2)
```

Optional. View visualizations that can be produced with some advanced geometries: [ggridges](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/gallery.html), [ggviolin](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/ggviolin.html), [ggmarginal](https://r-graph-gallery.com/277-marginal-histogram-for-ggplot2.html). The key to getting any of these advanced visualizations to work is to have the right information formatted correctly in a dataframe. Of course you should also consider that visualization best communicates the important information.
