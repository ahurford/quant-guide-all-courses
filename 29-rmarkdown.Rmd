# R markdown {#rmarkdown}

## Introduction

R Markdown provides a fully reproducible framework for presenting and sharing data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to both:

* save and execute code
* generate high quality written documents

R Markdown documents can be rendered to many output formats including HTML documents, PDFs, Word files, slideshows, etc.

### Installation

You can install the [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) package from CRAN:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

## Setup

To get started, open a new text file and save it with the extension .Rmd. Alternatively, if you are using RStudio, you can create a new Rmd file from the menu File -> New File -> R Markdown.

An R Markdown file contains three types of content:

1. An optional header that contains the document metadata and is surrounded by `---` on either side.

2. Chunks of R code surrounded by ` ``` ` and specifying `{r}` at the top.

3. Text that is easily formatted

In general, your R Markdown file will look like this when using RStudio.

```{r, fig.cap="R Markdown general setup", fig.align='center', out.width="70%", fig.show='hold', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./figures/RMarkdown1.png')
```

The header is written using [YAML](https://yaml.org) programming language. R Markdown files are often set as html documents and can be changed to a PDF or word document at any time. Alternatively, they can immediately be specified as `word_document`, etc.

You can run each code chunk by clicking the Run icon or small green triangle at the start of each chunk. RStudio executes the code and displays the results inline with the code. If you only want to prevent the source code from being displayed, you can set `{r, echo = FALSE}` at the start of the code chunk.

Note that text is written as you would in any word processing program, unlike `.R` files where you need to comment text using the pound symbol (#).

```{r, fig.cap="R Markdown output preview", fig.align='center', out.width="70%", fig.show='hold', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./figures/RMarkdown2.png')
```

Tip: Try to leave at least one empty line between adjacent elements, e.g., between a header and a paragraph or between text and code, to ensure everything renders properly.

## Syntax

It is very easy to modify your inline text. *Italic* text is produced by surrounding words with underscores or asterisks, e.g., `_italic_` or `*italic*`. **Bold** text is produced with a pair of double underscores or asterisks, e.g., `**bold**` or `__bold__`.

Superscripts are produced using a pair of carets (`^`), while subscripts require a pair of tildes (`~`), e.g. superscript^2^ vs subscript~2~.

### Headers

Section headers can be written after one or more pound signs (`#`), where increasing the number of pound signs increases the heading level.

```
# Primary header

## Secondary header

### Tertiary header

```

### Lists

You can create an list of **unordered items** by starting them with *, -, or +. Lists can be nested within another list by indenting the sub-list. Make sure to leave the line before the first bullet point blank.

```
List

- item
- item
- item
    - additional item
    - additional item

```

The output becomes:

List

- item
- item
- item
  - additional item
  - additional item

**Ordered list** items start with numbers. You can also nest unordered lists within ordered lists.
```
List 

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item
    - one unordered item
    - one unordered item
```

The output:

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item
  - one unordered item
  - one unordered item
